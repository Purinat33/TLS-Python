# Implementing TLS in Python Socket

Because a great way to learn is to make something yourself.

The steps taken in our code:

1. A standalone script must be ran to:
    * Generate Root CA public/private keys into files.
    * Generate and sign CA Certificate into a file using the CA's own private key.
    * Generate server's public/private keys into files.
    * Generate and sign the server's certificate with the Root CA's private key.
2. The certificates will contain:
    * Subject Name
    * Issuer Name
    * Common Name (What we are connecting to)
    * Serial Number
    * Period of Validity
    * The holder's **public key**
    * A unique signature using the CA's private key
3. The server binds to an IP and port
